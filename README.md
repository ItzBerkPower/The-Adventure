# The-Adventure


Text-based Adventure Game. 

- The game requires no external downloads apart from Python! Thus being said, the most recent version of Python is recommended

- This was made to help understand the basics of databases and loops, it only has the base of an adventure game, allowing you to add on to it!




Couple of things:

-> If you use Mac, change 'os.system('cls')' to 'os.system('clear')'
